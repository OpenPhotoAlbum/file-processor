  - [ ] Evaluate geographic coverage (global vs. regional)

- [ ] **MTB Trail Categories**
  ```typescript
  enum LandmarkCategory {
    MTB_TRAIL = 'mtb_trail',
    HIKING_TRAIL = 'hiking_trail', 
    BIKE_PARK = 'bike_park',
    JUMP_LINE = 'jump_line',
    FLOW_TRAIL = 'flow_trail',
    TECHNICAL_TRAIL = 'technical_trail'
  }
  ```

#### Phase 3: Integration Planning (Week 3)
- [ ] **Provider Design**
  - [ ] Design `TrailforksProvider` with OAuth2 handling
  - [ ] Plan trail difficulty mapping (Green/Blue/Black ‚Üí confidence levels)
  - [ ] Define trail feature detection (jumps, berms, technical sections)
  - [ ] Consider seasonal/conditions data integration

## üèõÔ∏è **National Register of Historic Places Provider**

### **Value Proposition**  
- **1.4+ million historic resources** with official federal data
- **Rich historical context**: Construction dates, architectural styles, significance
- **Comprehensive coverage**: Buildings, sites, districts, structures, objects
- **High data quality**: Officially maintained by National Park Service

### **Investigation Steps**

#### Phase 1: NPS MapServer Integration (Week 1)
- [ ] **API Endpoint Analysis**
  - [ ] Test NPS MapServer at `https://mapservices.nps.gov/arcgis/rest/services/cultural_resources/nrhp_locations/MapServer`
  - [ ] Study ArcGIS REST API query capabilities
  - [ ] Check spatial query support (lat/lng + distance)
  - [ ] Evaluate response format and available attributes

- [ ] **Data Quality Assessment**
  - [ ] Test coordinate accuracy (noted issues with transcription errors)
  - [ ] Validate point vs. polygon representations (<10 acres = points)
  - [ ] Check coverage completeness and data freshness
  - [ ] Identify excluded sensitive/restricted sites

#### Phase 2: Historical Categories (Week 2)
- [ ] **Category Mapping**
  ```typescript
  enum LandmarkCategory {
    HISTORIC_BUILDING = 'historic_building',
    HISTORIC_DISTRICT = 'historic_district', 
    HISTORIC_STRUCTURE = 'historic_structure',
    HISTORIC_SITE = 'historic_site',
    HISTORIC_OBJECT = 'historic_object',
    ARCHAEOLOGICAL_SITE = 'archaeological_site'
  }
  ```

- [ ] **Metadata Enhancement**

## üéØ **Unified Implementation Strategy**

### **Phase 1: Research & Planning (3 weeks parallel)**
All three providers investigated simultaneously to understand:
- API access requirements and restrictions
- Data quality and coverage 
- Integration complexity and effort required
- Expected value for photo context enhancement

### **Phase 2: Provider Selection & Prioritization**
Based on investigation results:
1. **Immediate implementation**: Providers with straightforward API access
2. **Conditional implementation**: Trailforks pending approval
3. **Fallback options**: Alternative trail data sources if needed

### **Phase 3: Technical Integration**
- [ ] **Database Schema Updates**
  - [ ] Add new landmark categories to types.ts
  - [ ] Extend Landmark interface for provider-specific fields
  - [ ] Update confidence scoring algorithms

- [ ] **Provider Registration**
  ```typescript
  // In landmark factory
  providers.push(new RecreationProvider(db));
  providers.push(new HistoricSitesProvider()); 
  if (trailforksApproved) {
    providers.push(new TrailforksProvider(oauth));
  }
  ```

- [ ] **Testing Enhancement**
  - [ ] Update CLI test mocks with new landmark types
  - [ ] Add coverage for recreation sites and historic places
  - [ ] Verify no performance degradation with additional providers

### **Phase 4: Documentation & Examples**
- [ ] **Enhanced JSON Output Examples**
  ```json
  {
    "landmarks": [
      {
        "name": "Franconia Notch State Park Campground",
        "category": "campground", 
        "provider": "Recreation.gov",
        "facilities": ["restrooms", "showers", "picnic_tables"],
        "availability": "seasonal_may_october"
      },
      {
        "name": "Cannon Mountain Ski Trail",
        "category": "mtb_trail",
        "provider": "Trailforks", 
        "difficulty": "blue_intermediate",
        "trail_features": ["berms", "flow_sections"],
        "conditions": "good_recent_maintenance"
      },
      {
        "name": "Mount Washington Hotel",
        "category": "historic_building",
        "provider": "NRHP",
        "built_year": 1902,
        "architectural_style": "Colonial Revival",
        "nrhp_date": "1978-11-07"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

## üìä **Success Metrics**

- **Coverage Enhancement**: Increase landmark detection rate by 50%+
- **Context Richness**: Add facility, historical, and trail-specific metadata
- **Photo Value**: Better identify recreation activities and historical contexts
- **Geographic Breadth**: Expand beyond natural features to human activities

## üöÄ **Next Steps**

1. **Week 1**: Begin parallel investigation of all three providers
2. **Trailforks Application**: Submit API access request immediately (longest lead time)
3. **Recreation.gov**: Start with documentation review and test queries
4. **Historic Places**: Test NPS MapServer API responses and data quality

Would you like me to start with any specific provider investigation, or shall we begin with documenting our approach to the Trailforks API application?
