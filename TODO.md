- [x] Add --overwrite flag for output file handling
- [x] Replace hardcoded testFiles in main.ts with professional CLI
- [x] Create comprehensive CLI documentation with examples

### üßπ Code Cleanup (Completed)
- [x] Refactor pre-processor to use FileSystemService for file discovery and validation
- [x] Update image processor to use FileSystemService for file stats and validation
- [x] Consolidate file validation across processors using FileSystemService
- [x] Remove duplicate filesystem code in extractors and utilities
- [x] Update sidecar discovery to use centralized service
- [x] Test all processors work correctly with FileSystemService integration

### üìö Documentation Updates (Completed)
- [x] Document FileSystemService architecture and usage
- [x] Create CLI usage documentation  
- [x] Update main README with new filesystem service
- [x] Add examples of filesystem service integration

## Design Decisions Made
- **Filesystem Service**: Centralized service layer for all file operations
- **CLI Library**: Commander.js for professional CLI experience
- **Path Handling**: Support both prefix paths and absolute paths with external: fallback
- **Output Control**: JSON/console output with optional file writing and --overwrite flag
- **Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns across multiple focused modules

## Next Steps

### üß™ CLI Response Testing Framework
- [ ] Create test structure: `tests/cli-response/` with mocks/ subdirectory
- [ ] Generate expected response files for each sample image in scratch/
- [ ] Build CLI test runner that executes commands and compares outputs
- [ ] Implement response validator with schema checking
- [ ] Add npm test script for CLI response validation
- [ ] Create documentation for maintaining test expectations

### üîç Performance Investigation (Completed)
- [x] Investigate MaxListenersExceededWarning for AbortSignal memory leaks
- [x] Review database connection pooling and cleanup patterns
- [x] Check for event listener accumulation in services

### üèîÔ∏è GNIS Geographic Features Integration (Implementation Ready)

**Architecture**: Minimal-impact integration using existing provider pattern and CLI testing approach

**File Changes Required:**
```
migrations/036_create_geo_geographic_features.sql     # NEW - Database table
scripts/load-gnis-data.ts                            # NEW - One-time data loader  
src/services/landmarks/providers/gnis.ts             # NEW - GNIS provider
src/services/landmarks/types.ts                      # MODIFY - Add categories
tests/cli-response/mocks/*.json                      # UPDATED - New landmark data
```

**Implementation Steps:**
- [ ] **Create Database Migration (036_create_geo_geographic_features.sql)**
  - [ ] Design table schema with spatial indexing
  - [ ] Include feature_id, feature_name, feature_class, coordinates, elevation
  - [ ] Add proper indexes for performance (spatial, feature_class, state)

- [ ] **Build Data Loading Script (scripts/load-gnis-data.ts)**
  - [ ] Download NH GNIS data from S3 as proof of concept
  - [ ] Parse pipe-delimited format: feature_id|feature_name|feature_class|...
  - [ ] Filter for relevant feature classes: Summit, Lake, Stream, Valley, Ridge, Falls
  - [ ] Insert with proper SRID spatial conversion
  - [ ] Add simple statistics logging

- [ ] **Implement GNIS Provider (src/services/landmarks/providers/gnis.ts)**
  - [ ] Follow existing NationalParksProvider pattern exactly
  - [ ] Map feature classes to categories (Summit‚Üímountain, Lake‚Üílake, etc.)
  - [ ] Use spatial queries matching geolocation service approach
  - [ ] Add GNIS-specific fields (feature_id, feature_class, elevation)
  - [ ] Calculate confidence based on distance and feature type

- [ ] **Update Landmark Types (src/services/landmarks/types.ts)**
  - [ ] Add new categories: mountain, lake, river, valley, ridge, water_feature
  - [ ] Extend Landmark interface for GNIS fields

- [ ] **Register Provider & Test**
  - [ ] Add GNISProvider to landmark service provider list
  - [ ] Run existing CLI tests on sample images
  - [ ] Update mock JSON files with new landmark data
  - [ ] Verify integration through CLI output

**Testing Strategy**: Use existing Jest CLI integration tests - no new unit tests needed
- Sample images will show new GNIS landmarks in JSON output
- Update mock expectations to match enriched responses  
- Monitor diffs for regressions
  - [ ] Ensure caching works with high-volume GNIS queries
  - [ ] Add GNIS feature statistics to enrichmentStatus

- [ ] **Enhanced JSON Output Structure**
  - [ ] Include GNIS feature_id for cross-referencing
  - [ ] Add feature_class from GNIS taxonomy
  - [ ] Include elevation for summits and water features
  - [ ] Add descriptive context for each feature
  - [ ] Provide detailed statistics by category and provider

- [ ] **Testing & Validation**
  - [ ] Create test cases for mountain/lake/river detection
  - [ ] Validate against known locations (e.g., Mount Washington area)
  - [ ] Test performance with 1M+ features in database
  - [ ] Ensure proper fallback when no features found
  - [ ] Verify coordinate system consistency
