- [x] Consolidate file validation across processors using FileSystemService
- [x] Remove duplicate filesystem code in extractors and utilities
- [x] Update sidecar discovery to use centralized service

### üìö Documentation Updates (Completed)
- [x] Document FileSystemService architecture and usage
- [x] Create CLI usage documentation  
- [x] Update main README with new filesystem service
- [x] Add examples of filesystem service integration

## Design Decisions Made
- **Filesystem Service**: Centralized service layer for all file operations
- **CLI Library**: Commander.js for professional CLI experience
- **Path Handling**: Support both prefix paths and absolute paths with external: fallback
- **Output Control**: JSON/console output with optional file writing and --overwrite flag
- **Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns across multiple focused modules

## Next Steps

### üß™ CLI Response Testing Framework (Completed)
- [x] Create test structure: `tests/cli-response/` with mocks/ subdirectory
- [x] Generate expected response files for each sample image in scratch/
- [x] Build CLI test runner that executes commands and compares outputs
- [x] Implement response validator with schema checking
- [x] Add npm test script for CLI response validation
- [x] Create documentation for maintaining test expectations

### üîç Performance Investigation (Completed)
- [x] Investigate MaxListenersExceededWarning for AbortSignal memory leaks
- [x] Review database connection pooling and cleanup patterns
- [x] Check for event listener accumulation in services

### üèîÔ∏è GNIS Geographic Features Integration (Completed)

**Architecture**: Minimal-impact integration using existing provider pattern and CLI testing approach

**File Changes Required:**
```
migrations/036_create_geo_geographic_features.sql     # NEW - Database table
scripts/load-gnis-data.ts                            # NEW - One-time data loader  
src/services/landmarks/providers/gnis.ts             # NEW - GNIS provider
src/services/landmarks/types.ts                      # MODIFY - Add categories
tests/cli-response/mocks/*.json                      # UPDATED - New landmark data
```

**Implementation Steps:**
- [x] **Create Database Migration (055_table_geo_geographic_features.sql)**
  - [x] Design table schema with spatial indexing
  - [x] Include feature_id, feature_name, feature_class, coordinates, elevation
  - [x] Add proper indexes for performance (spatial, feature_class, state)

- [x] **Build Data Loading Scripts**
  - [x] Load complete US GNIS dataset (654K+ features) via individual state SQL files
  - [x] Parse pipe-delimited format: feature_id|feature_name|feature_class|...
  - [x] Filter for relevant feature classes: Summit, Lake, Stream, Valley, Ridge, Falls
  - [x] Insert with proper SRID spatial conversion
  - [x] Add comprehensive US municipal boundaries (267 municipalities across 17 states)

- [x] **Implement GNIS Provider (src/services/landmarks/providers/gnis.ts)**
  - [x] Follow existing NationalParksProvider pattern exactly
  - [x] Map feature classes to categories (Summit‚Üímountain, Lake‚Üílake, etc.)
  - [x] Use spatial queries with haversine formula for accurate distance calculation
  - [x] Add GNIS-specific fields (feature_id, feature_class, county, subcategory)
  - [x] Calculate confidence based on distance and feature type

- [x] **Update Landmark Types (src/services/landmarks/types.ts)**
  - [x] Add new categories: mountain, lake, river, valley, ridge, water_feature, natural_feature
  - [x] Extend Landmark interface for GNIS fields

- [x] **Register Provider & Test**
  - [x] Add GNISProvider to landmark service provider list
  - [x] Run existing CLI tests on sample images
  - [x] Update mock JSON files with new landmark data
  - [x] Verify integration through CLI output with comprehensive testing coverage

**Testing Strategy**: Use existing Jest CLI integration tests - no new unit tests needed
- [x] Sample images show new GNIS landmarks in JSON output
- [x] Updated mock expectations to match enriched responses  
- [x] Monitor diffs for regressions
- [x] Ensure caching works with high-volume GNIS queries
- [x] Add GNIS feature statistics to enrichmentStatus

- [x] **Enhanced JSON Output Structure**
  - [x] Include GNIS feature_id for cross-referencing
  - [x] Add feature_class from GNIS taxonomy  
  - [x] Include subcategory and county information
  - [x] Add descriptive context for each feature
  - [x] Provide detailed statistics by category and provider

- [x] **Testing & Validation**
  - [x] Create test cases for mountain/lake/river detection
  - [x] Validate against known locations (Acadia National Park, Rollinsford NH)
  - [x] Test performance with 650K+ features in database
  - [x] Ensure proper fallback when no features found
  - [x] Verify coordinate system consistency with SRID 4326
